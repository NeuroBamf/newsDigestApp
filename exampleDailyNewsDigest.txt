Federal judge orders stop to indiscriminate immigration raids in Los Angelestoggle caption Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty ImagesA federal judge in Los Angeles ordered the Trump administration to stop carrying out immigration sweeps in which she said federal agents have been indiscriminately arresting people across southern California without reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.
The orders, which apply to Los Angeles and six surrounding counties, are temporary while the case moves forward.
Sponsor MessageJudge Frimpong said during Thursday's hearing that she was skeptical of the government's general assurances that immigration agents are not arresting people arbitrarily.
She said the government could have been more convincing by explaining the specific reasons that agents arrested Vasquez Perdomo or several other plaintiffs in the case.
Whether immigration agents will scale back their aggressive tactics in response to the judge's order is unclear.
